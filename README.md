Bilk is a web application built with Python / Django that allows anyone to convert their long links to short snippets for better sharing across the web. It uses a PostgreSQL database to store original and shortened links.

## Technologies and Frameworks Used

- <strong>Front-end:</strong> Bootstrap
- <strong>Back-end:</strong> Django, Python, PostgreSQL
- <strong>Deployment:</strong> Heroku

## Future Plans

Ideally, I would like to acquire a domain such as 'bilk.co' so links can be as succinct possible. The current herokuapp extension adds a significant amount of characters to shortened links.
